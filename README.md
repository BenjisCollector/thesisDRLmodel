# README for Sentiment Analysis and Trading Model

## Description
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the integration of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with sentiment and technical indicators for algorithmic trading. The `SentimentAnalysis.ipynb` focuses on extracting and analyzing sentiment from financial news articles. The `Dissertation_Notebook.ipynb` outlines the application of DRL models to predict market trends and make trading decisions.

## Prerequisites
To run these notebooks, you will need:
- Python 3.6 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Dependencies
Install the following libraries to ensure the notebooks function correctly:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras nltk
```

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BenjisCollector/thesisDRLmodel/tree/main
```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the cloned directory.
2. Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
3. Open the `SentimentAnalysis.ipynb` or `Dissertation_Notebook.ipynb` file in Jupyter.
4. **Important:** You need to provide your own price data and sentiment data for the analysis. Ensure these datasets are formatted correctly as per the notebook requirements.
5. Run the cells in the notebook to see the analysis and model simulations.

## Features
- Sentiment analysis with advanced natural language processing techniques.
- Deep reinforcement learning models integrated with real-time market data and sentiment analysis.
- Visualization of trading simulations and performance metrics.
